Conezia is YourLifeConnected: connected to every people you have any relationship with physically or philosophically, online services

Other apps may use conezia as a basis for account management, relationship management and authentication to external services.Conezia does not neeed to offer OAuth service in itself. Apps powered by Conezia will use Conezia for above features by default. Their users do not have to go through any additional authorization. If a user does not have Conezia account, new member registration on that app will result in member registration in Conezia.

Robust API along with documentation should be created so that apps can use it in full

Authentication may be based on google auth, email/password, or other social networks. We can start with google auth.

Basic features are
- Relationship maangement with any type entity that includes people, things, animals, organizations, external services etc
- Communication with the entities, through internal chat, external chat, email, phone, etc
- History of interaction or notes with the entities
- Description of the entities
- Management of uniqueness such as phone number, email address, SSN, etc
- Mapping and management of user registered account against relationship entities added and managed by various users
